#Scale sample with two methods
benefits:
*Improved Convergence in Gradient-Based Models
*Better Performance in Distance-Based Algorithms
*Uniformity Across Features

#apply and test dimensionality reduction PCA and t-SNE methods 

PCA: A linear method which finds the orthogonal axes (principal components) that capture the most variance in the data.

t-SNE: A non-linear method which models pairwise similarities of data points with a probability distribution, preserving small-scale (local) structure rather than large-scale (global) structure.

# select balanced sample to train models

models includes: logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours, Random forest, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes.

# cross-validation added, 

# learning curves added
